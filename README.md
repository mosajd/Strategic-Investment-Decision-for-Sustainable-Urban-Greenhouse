<h2>Strategic Investment Decision for Sustainable Urban Greenhouse</h2>

This project, conducted as part of the "Strategic Program" course within the <a href="http://www.itim.unige.it/cs/strategos/">"Engineering Technology for Strategy and Security (Strategos)"</a> Master's program, aims to make a strategic investment decision for an hypothetical urban greenhouse to achieve sustainability in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It builds upon the insights gained from my previous project for 'fundamentals of strategic management' involving an <a href="https://github.com/mosajd/Agent-Based-Modeling-for-Strategic-Management-of-Urban-Food-Energy-Water-Nexus">agent-based model for strategic management of urban food-energy-water nexus for sustainable development</a>, specifically focusing on the interactions between different types of urban farms.

The customer in this project is an Eco-Environmentally Focused farm, and the project utilizes Cost-Benefit Analysis (BCA) methodology, including Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Payback Period (PP), and Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR), along with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) from Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) to guide the decision-making process.

After thorough evaluation of all criteria against potential alternatives, the project recommends investing in a Hybrid PV-Rainwater Harvesting System. Subsequently, a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Gantt chart are created to outline 47 activities involved in the implementation process.

The Critical Path Method is employed to determine the critical path, which identifies the longest sequence of activities that determines the overall project duration. Furthermore, risk assessment using Monte Carlo simulation is conducted, and activities scheduling for the installation phase is optimized using an optimization solver.

This project demonstrates the application of strategic and analytical tools to make informed decisions for sustainable urban agriculture practices, contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
